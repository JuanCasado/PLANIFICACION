## Rocket domain

A rocket can mean a type of engine or a vehicle that uses that engine. Like most engines, rockets burn fuel. Most rocket engines turn the fuel into hot gas. The engine pushes the gas out its back. The gas makes the rocket move forward. A rocket engine doesn't need air. It carries with it everything it needs. A rocket engine works in space, where there is no air. NASA uses rockets to launch satellites. It also uses rockets to send probes to other worlds. These rockets include the Atlas V, the Delta II, the Pegasus and Taurus. NASA uses smaller "sounding rockets" for scientific research.  NASA also is working on a powerful new rocket called a heavy lift vehicle that will be able to take big loads into space. Together, these new rockets will make it possible to explore other worlds. Someday they may send humans to Mars (https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/k-4/stories/nasa-knows/what-is-a-rocket-k4.html).

Consider the problem where you have rockets to load and unload things or astronauts and send them back and forth space/Earth. Rockets can fly from a start location to a destination but only once (they run out of fuel). Use PDDL to model the problem of moving cargos and people from different locations. Differentiate the cargos that are things from humans. Use types in PDDL to do that.
