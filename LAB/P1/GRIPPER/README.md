## Domains

* gripper.pddl

They have the same content, the second one is just typed

## Problems

* gripper-four-balls.pddl //The example
* exercise2.pddl
* exercise3.pddl

The problem-typed is meant to be run with gripper-typed.pddl, it is the exercise3 but with types added.
The other problems are meant to be run with gripper.pddl
