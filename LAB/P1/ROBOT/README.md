## Domains

The domain and problem correspond to part 3. 
The robot can travel through the rooms and switch on and off the lights as well as to push blocks to reach the switches.

when the robot opens a door or pushes a box it does not change its location, which is intended.
The robot only changes its location when it performs the action GO from one room to another though an open dor.

Note that the domain is defined to allow any number of robots on it.
