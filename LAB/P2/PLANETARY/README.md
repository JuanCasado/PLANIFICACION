# PLANETARY

* There can be more than one rover.
* The rover can do two tasks (TAKE_PHOTO and DRILL)
* Actions and movements have been designed to simplify the domain definition:
  With just one action the rover can move at both speeds and with also just one action the rover can perform both tasks.
* The tasks can be performed multiple times for each location.
