# River

The problem of the farmer that wants to cross a river with a wolf, a sheep and a cabbage is quite famous.
This same problem has been formulated in quite a few different ways and quite a few different historical times.
From the Arabian night's until the Simpsons or with a fox, a chicken and a grain.

Some of the formulations of the problem conceptually allow to extend it from itÂ´s original 3 dimensional restriction set to an n-dimensional restriction set.
This is the case with the husbands or the cannibals formulations.

Even though it is a restriction problem it can be solved through planning technics.
